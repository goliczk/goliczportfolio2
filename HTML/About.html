	<p class="welcome">Here is a little bit about me: </p>
    <br>
 <div class="about">   <img src="../images/me.jpg" alt="me">
    <p>I graduated from Grand Valley State University in December of 2014 with a Bachelors in Marketing & Sales. I chose this as my major because I really liked marketing and I liked to see how both marketing and sales worked together to help a company grow. I don't particularly like sales, but I found it useful in how everything worked together and also it helped me become a lot more personable. </p>

	<p> I worked as a Marketing Intern for about a year and a half at a travel agency in Grand Rapids. During this internship, I began working with HTML and Wordpress. I primarily debugged the code and adjusted any information that needed to be put in. After leaving, I began to look into CSS, PHP, and a bit of JavaScript.</p>
    <p> When I moved back to the East side of the state, I started looking for positions that involved marketing and my coding skills. I've primarily used a bit of HTML in building Wordpress sites since graduation. </p>
    <p> Currently, I am working to hone my skills at Grand Circus. </p></div>
